## Generative-Adversarial-Network
Generating Fake Images using CIFAR10 dataset for training.

##### Generative Adversarial Network was discover by IAN Goodfellow.

Gans are generally used for generating fake images, we call it fake because it generates images of thing that doen't exist.

### Generator
It is a de-convolutional neural network which takes in a noise or random vectors and then passes the input to the network to generate
images.

##### This is a convolutional neural network which is used for classifying an image.
___

If we reverse the architecture, we will have a new architecture called a `De-convolution neural network`.

### Discriminator
It is a normal convolutional network which takes an image as a input and output its probability of classes. In Gans, work of 
discriminator is to detect whether the image generated by the `Generator` is `Real or Fake`.


### How these two works?
The working of Gans is simple the genearor generated image from noise and discriminator detects if they are real or fake.
Hence, the name `Adversarial` is used because the `Discriminator` learns in adversary of `Generator`.

### What if we train the Discriminator first and then train the Generator?
We can't train the discriminator first, the answer is simple, if we train the `Discriminator` first then it would get smarter at
detecting the fake image generated by the `Generator` it will always give negative output to the `Generator` as a result the generator
will find it hard to fool the `Discriminator` and our objective of generating fake images will not be accomplished. 
So, we should train them and let them learn together.

### GAN ARCHITECTURE
___
#### We stack the Discriminator to the top of Generator.

### Generator gets better and better creating fake images over epochs.
To train GANS we need high computational power and time as well. Because, we have two neural networks.
